# Changelog

All notable changes to attune are documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog 1.1.0](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning 2.0.0](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- **Observability overlay** (`deploy/docker-compose.obs.yml`) — optional
  Prometheus + Grafana stack (pinned images, memory-capped) layered with
  `-f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.obs.yml` (#6). Auto-provisions the
  Prometheus datasource and the "Attune Overview" dashboard, and documents the
  `attune_*` metrics as a backend-agnostic contract in `observability/README.md`.
- CI: a `deploy/**`-filtered `docker compose config` smoke check.
- **TLS overlay** (`deploy/docker-compose.tls.yml` + `Caddyfile.example`) — front
  attune with Caddy for automatic HTTPS (#7).
- **Private-deployment guide** (`docs/private-deploy.md`) — a verified
  external-user walkthrough, kept honest by a CI-run happy-path smoke test
  (`scripts/smoke-deploy.sh`), a deploy-doc-rot gate, and a markdown link
  checker (#7).

### Changed

- Renamed the bundled Grafana dashboard "Attune Overview (Wave 1.2)" → "Attune
  Overview" and removed internal roadmap jargon from `observability/` and the
  `metrics` package doc (no metric names changed).

### Security

- Bounded the `source` label on `attune_ingest_total`: a rejected (invalid)
  client-supplied `source` is now recorded as `invalid` instead of the raw value,
  closing an unbounded metric-cardinality vector on the ingest validation-error
  path.

## [0.2.0] - 2026-06-05

### Added

- **Private-deploy docker-compose kit** under `deploy/` (#5): `docker-compose.yml`
  (attune + postgres), a documented `.env.example`, an optional `config.yaml`
  template, and a quickstart `README.md`. `cd deploy && cp .env.example .env &&
  docker compose up -d` brings up a hardened (loopback-bound, `no-new-privileges`,
  read-only attune rootfs), persistent stack; first-tenant bootstrap via
  `docker compose run --rm attune tenant create / keys issue`.
- **`/healthz` liveness endpoint** (#5) — the Kubernetes/cloud-native convention
  (trailing `z` avoids colliding with a real application route).

### Changed

- **BREAKING — project-wide rename `listen` → `attune`** (#8). The Go module
  path is now `github.com/Phixsura/attune`; the binary/command is `attune`
  (was `listen`); Prometheus metrics use the `attune_*` prefix (dashboard +
  scrape job relabelled); the outbound webhook signature header is
  `X-Attune-Signature`, GitHub-dispatch labels are `attune/*`, and the
  `User-Agent` is `attune/<n>`; console session cookies are `attune_session` /
  `attune_oauth_state`. Pre-1.0, so this lands as a single breaking change —
  update any scrapers, dashboards, webhook verifiers, or label filters
  accordingly. The `FEEDBACK_API_*` env prefix is intentionally unchanged.

### Removed

- **BREAKING — the `/health` endpoint is removed** (#5); use `/healthz` instead.
  Pre-1.0, so it lands as a flagged minor bump (CLAUDE.md §3). Update any uptime
  monitor, load-balancer, or container probe that hit `/health`.

### Security

- Bump dependencies carrying published advisories: `github.com/jackc/pgx/v5`
  5.9.1→5.9.2 (GHSA-j88v-2chj-qfwx), `golang.org/x/net`→0.55.0 and
  `golang.org/x/sys`→0.45.0 (GO-2026-4918 / 5024–5030), and `vitest`→4.1
  (GHSA-5xrq-8626-4rwp). `govulncheck` confirms none of the Go advisories were
  reachable from attune's code, and `vitest` is a test-only dependency with no
  tests and no UI server, so there was no exploitable exposure — bumped for
  hygiene and to clear the alerts.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-06-04

### Added

- Initial public release (Apache-2.0).
- Go 1.25 HTTP server (chi router + structured slog + OpenTelemetry).
- PostgreSQL storage with auto-applied migrations.
- LLM enrichment via any OpenAI-compatible `/v1/chat/completions` endpoint
  (OpenAI / Azure OpenAI / vllm / ollama / oneapi).
- Outbound delivery — Lark group bot webhooks (inline, best-effort) and
  customer HTTPS webhooks (via outbox, at-least-once).
- Stage B web console (React + Vite + biome) for tenant / API key /
  notify-target / feedback CRUD.
- Prometheus `/metrics` endpoint and a base Grafana dashboard JSON shipped
  under `observability/dashboards/`.
- Configurable per-tenant token-bucket rate limiting.
- Lark event subscription handler with signature verification.
